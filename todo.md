# Flow

-   Questionnaire that guides the person to come up with a phrase of something they struggle with internalizing
    
-   The final phrase is in a “you” statement that should be something encouraging to push us in the right direction
    
-   Two paths at the end:
    

-   Level 1: Download an audio file of an automated voice reading out the phrase
    
-   Level 2: Copy / paste a prompt that you text to a friend who you are asking to send a voice note reading out the phrase
    

  

# Concept

-   Why are there things that we know we want to do rationally but struggle with? Perhaps the inner voice is a voice that we can more easily discredit or ignore and an external voice can allow us to actually “hear it” and having something we can replay in moments of doubt can turn it into something more impactful that will actually sink in?
    
-   If we loop someone else in, can this be a form of mutual aid and support? Can this framing allow us to ask for help when it can be hard to share our struggles? Will this open up a conversation to something deeper or create a level of accountability?

# Questions / Considerations

-   Maybe no option for the download path?
    
-   How to help the person be focused and mindful?
    

-   Headphones on? Ambient music playing?
    

-   Does the person’s submission get saved? Can they access it in the future? Or is it temporary / one-time?
    

-   Encode the phrase in the QR code? [https://dev.to/theudemezue/how-to-generate-a-qr-code-in-javascript-fhk](https://dev.to/theudemezue/how-to-generate-a-qr-code-in-javascript-fhk)
    

-   How to make it accessible to the person?
    

-   QR Code that downloads a file or opens up a page to copy / text a template for sending to a friend
